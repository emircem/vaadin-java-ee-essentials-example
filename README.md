# A simple Vaadin + Java EE example

An example app that uses "bom" to collect relevant dependencies needed for a small Vaadin Java EE app.

The [vaadin-java-ee-essentials](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-java-ee-essentials) can be defined as parent or simply as a dependency. Latter is bit more flexible, former simpler. Check out the other branch for parent project style usage.

The app itself has just a simple PhoneBook implementation using an in memory backend.
