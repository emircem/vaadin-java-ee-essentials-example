/**
 * This is a small tutorial application for Vaadin. It also uses Vaadin CDI (so
 * deploy to Java EE server) and a dependency collection for small Java EE +
 * Vaadin applications.
 *
 * Note, that this application is just to showcase Vaadin UI development and
 * some handy utilities. Pretty much whole application is just dumped into this
 * class. For larger apps where you strive for excellent testability and
 * maintainability, you most likely want to use better structured UI code. E.g.
 * google for "Vaadin MVP pattern".
